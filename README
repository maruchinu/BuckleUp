# Introduction

BuckleUp is a GUI for creating config files for the sandbox-exec command in Mac OS X (introduced in 10.5 Leopard). The command can be used to launch a program and limiting it's capabilities to those that are specified in the sandbox config (entitlements).

The sandbox feature in Mac OS X is referred to as "Seatbelt" (seatbelt.kext) by Apple, therefore the name BuckleUp.
